Goals that I wish to accomplish before the 2024 Season

- Maintain a high quality of code with comments during Preseason

- Integrate new swerve code with 2023 bot

- Experiment with PathPlanner and new swerve code focusing on pathing and movement

- Add functions with intake(and maybe conveyor belt and arm) to PathPlanner while having accurate pathing
